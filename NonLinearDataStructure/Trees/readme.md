# Binary Trees
- Let's Imagine a Tree What does it have?
- - Root
- - leafs
- - Branches

- Similarily, In computer science we have Tree (see above)
- <image height="400px" style = "position :relative" src = "src\1.png"></image>

- So tree have root and each node connecting to each other
- let's take an real example of tree : 
- <image height="400px" style = "position :relative" src = "src\2.png"></image> 
- Fun Activity (if you are on windows open up your cmd prompt and run below command) : 
```bat
tree
```
- - Cmd will List a tree data structure of windows file
- - Cancel it by cntrl + c because there are millions of files ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
