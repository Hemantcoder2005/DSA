# Binary Trees
Let's Imagine a Tree What does it have?
- Root
- leafs
- Branches

- Similarily, In computer science we have Tree (see above)
 <image height="400px" style = "position :relative" src = "src\1.png"></image>

- So tree have root and each node connecting to each other
- let's take an real example of tree : 
 <image height="400px" style = "position :relative" src = "src\2.png"></image>
