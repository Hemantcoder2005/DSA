# Bubble Sort Algorithm

Bubble sort is a straightforward sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list to be sorted, compares each pair of adjacent items, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until no swaps are needed, which indicates that the list is sorted. Bubble sort is not efficient for large datasets, as it has a worst-case and average-case time complexity of O(n^2). However, it is easy to understand and implement, making it suitable for educational purposes or for sorting small lists.
